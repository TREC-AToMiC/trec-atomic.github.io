- Text collection update: We have addressed the missing entity issues in our text collection and have released an updated version, `AToMiC-Text-v0.2.1`. For those interested in participating in the TREC2023 evaluation, please use this version. If you wish to reproduce the results presented in our SIGIR paper, please use `AToMiC-Text-v0.2`. We have created a spreadsheet highlighting the differences in retrieval effectiveness between the two versions, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wSi_79Qx3GA1WAirwvoapiWJ4m2bPRM_rtUWRZ2qRIo/edit?usp=sharing).
