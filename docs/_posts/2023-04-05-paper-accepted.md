The AToMiC dataset for the TREC 2023 evaluation is now available at the following locations:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/TREC-AToMiC/AToMiC)
- [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/TREC-AToMiC)

WTo aid exploration of the dataset, we have included notebooks [here](https://github.com/TREC-AToMiC/AToMiC/tree/main/notebooks).
TAdditionally, the resource paper that accompanies the dataset is now available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01961).

## Changes
- Expanded the text collection by including text-only samples (English Wikipedia articles) without any associated images. The previous version (v0.1) only contained paired image-text examples.
- Expanded the image collection by incorporating images from non-English languages. The previous version only included images attached to English articles.
