title: "What is AToMiC?"
---

**A**uthoring **To**ols for **M**ult**i**media **C**ontent (AToMiC) Track at the Text Reterieval Conference [(TREC)](https://trec.nist.gov/) is intended to encourage research in multimedia search systems.
We aim to provide evaluation resources and toolkits for researchers from information retrieval, natural language
processing, computer vision, and multimedia communities.

## Motivation

Multimedia search is still a challenging task.
The ever-growing production of text--image data has brought many works from different research communities to address the problem of effectively accessing multimedia resources.
However, their capabilities for real-world applications is still questionable.
The *de facto* image--text datasets (Flickr30k and MS-COCO) are constructed to generate image-text associations based on high-level concepts (i.e., describing generic objects such as mountain, or cat), while real-world multimedia search applications often deal with very specific semantic entities (e.g. Mount Fuji, or Larry the Cat).
Hence, we need a better proxy to evaluate multimodal retrieval systems.

## Tasks

The TREC 2023 AToMiC track is organised with two tasks of the standard *ad hoc* retrieval setup.
We assume the existence of a corpus $$\mathcal{C}$$ comprised of a collection of documents $$\{d_1, d_2 \ldots d_n\}$$.
In response to a user’s information need represented as query $$q$$.
The system’s goal is to return a top-$$k$$ ranked list of documents that maximizes some metric of quality such as nDCG or MRR.

For TREC 2023, we provide two different collections: a collection of texts $$\mathcal{C}_{T} = \{t_1, t_2 \ldots t_n\}$$ ($$t$$ stands for text) and a collection of images $$\mathcal{C}_{M} = \{m_1, m_2 \ldots m_n\}$$ ($$m$$ stands for media).

### Image Suggestion
An information need (for convenience, a *query*, denoted $$q$$, is simply a text $$t$$ drawn from $$\mathcal{C}_T$$, i.e., $$q \in \mathcal{C}_T$$.
That is, an editor of Wikipedia examines a *specific section* of an article and wishes to locate an appropriate image in the collection $$\mathcal{C}_{M}$$.

### Image Promotion
This task is the inverse of the image suggestion task.
The query $$q$$ is an image drawn from $$\mathcal{C}_{M}$$ and the collection to be searched is $$\mathcal{C}_{T}$$.
