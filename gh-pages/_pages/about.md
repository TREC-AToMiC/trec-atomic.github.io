Our work tackles the challenge of providing assistance to authors in multimedia content creation.
To enhance the appeal of web pages that are primarily textual in nature (e.g., a descriptive article about a topic, a travel blog post, etc.), authors can add appropriate multimedia content to complement the text (e.g., images, video, etc.). 
We aim to build tools that help content creators in this task, which we dub Authoring Tools for Multimedia Content (AToMiC). 
To provide evaluation resources, share baselines, and foster a community around this challenge, we will organize the AToMiC Track at the 2023 Text Retrieval Conference (TREC).
